           writer Lynn Hightower, a devoted mother must confront the paranormal
           forces that have cursed her family.
           When Olivia James receives a phone call just after midnight,

           her brother has been dead for the past nine weeks. Moving back
           to her old childhood home in Tennessee--the place where her
           brother has just died--her young daughter Teddy seems troubled,
           telling her mother that she’s being visited by a menacing ghost.
           When another tragic death occurs and her daughter disappears,
           Olivia must confront the demonic force that has cursed her family.

        <h3>Even in Darkness </h3>
        <p>
          Joy Miller, once a famed TV evangelist, retired years before when two
          tragedies struck her family: the first leading her husband to suicide;
          the second leaving her son dead and his wife and daughter estranged
          from her.
          She now lives a lonely, reclusive life, until a package arrives in the
          mail containing graphic photographs of three people she knew long ago
          - all brutally murdered. When Joy reads the note in the package, she
          knows immediately who it's from: a ghost from her past, a dangerous
          individual who knows far too much about the skeletons in Joy's
          closet. Then people start disappearing ...

        <h3>Flashpoint</h3>
        <p>
          A New York Times Notable Book: Cincinnati homicide detective Sonora
          Blair hunts a serial killer who's playing with fire in Shamus
          Award—winning author Lynn Hightower's chilling thriller.
          A single mother of two children and a police specialist with the
          Cincinnati Homicide Division, Sonora Blair is still awake in the
          middle of the night when the call comes in. Mark Daniels has been
          found in Mount Airy Forest handcuffed to the steering wheel of
          his car, doused with accelerant, and set on fire. As the hideously
          burned college student lies dying in the ER, he describes his killer:
          blond, female, and a total stranger. But Mark may not have been the
          intended victim.
          Evidence points to a sexual fixation on his older brother, Keaton,
          a teacher currently separated from his wife. Then the murderer—who
          has been dubbed "Flash" by the media—calls Sonora one night, taunting
          and mocking her. As the investigation heats up, the harassment
          continues. The female psychopath knows intimate details about Sonora's
          family and her past. As the criminal's monstrous plan becomes
          chillingly apparent, Sonora must risk everything to corner a cunning killer.
